    <li>DHT11with/noLCD: <br />Reads the DHT11 temperature and humidity and displays it on the lcd module with an internal time calculator</li>
    <li>joystickTeensy: <br />Implements a HID mouse functionality via joystick. A toggle switch for the mouse is also incorporated with an algorithm to calibrate the joystick
    </li>
    <li>NeoPixelSingle/MultipleStrips: <br />An audio reactive script for ws2811 BULBS (not the light strips) in cases that you do not have light stips. Reacts upon the amplitude of the sound, and not the amplitude of certain frequencies...yet.</li>
